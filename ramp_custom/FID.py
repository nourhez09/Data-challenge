    Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation.
    
    This metric computes the difference between the statistics of the
    generated images and the real images. Lower values indicate that the
    generated images are closer to the real ones.
    
    Note: This implementation flattens images and computes covariances
    directly. For more robust evaluations, it is common to extract features
    using a pre-trained network such as Inception.
